// Recursion

1) Definition : 
        Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

2) Recursive function :
        A function that calls itself again and again till it reaches the base case.


3) Base Case:
        A condition that terminates the recursion call.


4) Direction of recursion :
        - A direction in which the function will call itself.
        - Types:
            a) Upward direction/ Forward direction - From bottom to top or from left to right
            b) Downward direction/ Backward direction - From top to bottom or from right to left
