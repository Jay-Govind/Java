Object Oriented Programming

Definition :
OOPs is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects and their interactions. It is a way to structure code in a way that makes it easier to manage and reuse code.

    1. Classes and Objects :
        A class is a template for creating objects, which are instances of that class.
        An object is an instance of a class, and it has its own state and behavior.

        Note :
            Object is "a real world entity" and Class is "a blueprint of a real world entity".


    2. Access Modifiers :
        Access Modifiers are used to control the accessibility of class members.

        There are four types of access modifiers:
            1. Public : accessible from anywhere.
            2. Protected : accessible within the class and its subclasses.
            3. Default : accessible within the same package.
            4. Private : accessible only within the class.


    3. Getters and Setters :
        Getters and Setters are methods that allow you to access and modify the state of an object.
        Getters are used to read the state of an object, while Setters are used to modify the state of an object.


    4. Encapsulation :
        Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together into a single unit called a class. It also implements data hiding.


    5. Constructors :
        Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is created.
        They are used to initialize the state of an object.

        There are four types of constructors:
            1. Default Constructor/Non-Parameterized Constructor : called when an object is created without any arguments.
            2. Parameterized Constructor : called when an object is created with arguments.
            3. Copy Constructor : called when an object is created by copying another object.

        Note: Contructor Overloading is the process of creating multiple constructors with different parameters.
