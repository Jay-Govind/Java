Object Oriented Programming

Definition : 
    OOPs is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects and their interactions. It is a way to structure code in a way that makes it easier to manage and reuse code.

    
    1. Classes and Objects :
        A class is a template for creating objects, which are instances of that class.
        An object is an instance of a class, and it has its own state and behavior.

        Note : Object is "a real world entity" and Class is "a blueprint of a real world entity".
